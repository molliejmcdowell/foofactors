This is a practice package for STAT545. This package contains two functions: 
* fbind: binds factors together
* freq_out: creates a frequency table for factors

Here is an example of each function:

```{r}
library(devtools)
library(foofactors)
load_all()
fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
freq_out(iris$Species)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```
